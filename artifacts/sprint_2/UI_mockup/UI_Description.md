# UI Description
Our application consists of the following sections. A header containing the title of the project, account login links, links to additional educational COVID resources, and a link to our project's GitHub. The left body will hold dropdowns to manually select a US state, and select a county once state is selected. It also will hold an interactive map of the US that will dynamically highlight and zoom to chosen state/county and will allow choosing state/county via mouse-click on the map. The right body will hold all data and statistics, including a line graph with both historical COVID data as well as ML predictions. The user can select how many weeks in the future for the model to predict into. Below this element will be sections for risk factor entry and risk assessment generation. The risk factors will be entered first then a risk assessment producing a likelihood of exposure can be generated based on the factors and location selected. This risk assessment can be saved to a user's profile if the user has created an account to track risk over time and save risk factor settings.
