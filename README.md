# myflorida-covid-tracker

# Vision Statement
Our product will be for any Florida resident or visitor who wishes to gain knowledge on the risk of Covid-19 contraction by traveling to major counties in Florida. The product will help users assess the risk of traveling based on predictions that the product makes. The product's name is the myFlorida Covid-19 Tracker and would be available as a basic desktop application. This application will give the user the ability to enter conditions that the user will be traveling in. For example, the user can indicate how much they will be exposed, or how many people they may interact with. Data provided by the Florida Department of Health will be used to train a model that can predict Covid-19 trends in a given county will be used to create a risk assessment for the county that the user wants to travel to. Unlike services like Google and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) tracking maps, this will be specific to Florida and will use Machine Learning algorithms to actually give the user an honest risk assessment as opposed to raw data only. Our product would offer the ability to see up to two months in advance.
